#Getting Started

## Make sure these are installed
- node package manager

## Setup
- clone repository
- go into the cloned repo and run
$npm install
$npm run build
$npm run start
- A new browser window should open to localhost:8080

#Code Structure
- /dist contains distributable files generated by webpack
- /node_modules contains node package files and their dependencies
- /src is where the app code lives and the entry files
- /src/components are where the components live
- /src/components/sub are where the child components for the root component of our single-page application live

#Technical Decisions

## Framework
I chose React because I like React and I wanted to practice my React skills a bit. React is also great for single-page web applications.

## Data Visualization library
In my React app, I could not use D3 because
1) D3 manipulates the real DOM
3) Tried using react-d3-library, but it uses a babel plugin my version of babel does not recognize.
